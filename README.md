Meet Zhi Li, a die-hard soccer fan who is excited for the upcoming World Cup. He loves watching the games and cheering for his favorite team, but he also enjoys the competition and strategic thinking involved in making decisions, and feels there is not a great platform currently out there to do so.

One day, Zhi Li learns about our World Cup prediction game and decides to give it a try. He downloads the software from GitHub, creates an account, and starts to make his predictions for the upcoming matches. He finds the user interface to be intuitive and easy to use, and he enjoys the social aspect of the game, which allows him to compete with his friends, family and students, to see who has the best predictions.

Eventually, the World Cup reaches the final stage and he is in 2nd place, incredibly close to the first place position. He is on the edge of his seat as he watches the final match, and his predictions are on the line. He has bet that Portugall will beat Argentina 2-1, and first place in the league has bet 2-1 for Argentina. In the 92nd minute of the match, Portugal get a penalty... Cristiano Ronaldo stands up to take it. Ronaldo takes a deep breath... the ref blows the whistle... Ronaldo shoots the ball into the top right corner... GOAAAALLLLLL!!! Portugal have won the World Cup and Zhi Li has won his prediction league, and has won bragging rights for the next 4 years in his friend group. He can hardly believe it , and is thrilled to see that he has come out on top of the leaderboard in his league with friends.

**_PROJECT EVOLUTION_**

As the World Cup began, three ambitious software developers - Benji, Maria and Callum - set out on a mission to create the ultimate World Cup prediction game.

The first step in their journey was to brainstorm ideas. As they sat in their office, they threw around different concepts and eventually landed on the idea of creating a tool that would allow users to make predictions about the outcomes of World Cup matches.

With their idea in place, the next step was to find the right API to power their project. After hours of research, they finally found the perfect API and set to work building the functions that would allow them to pull data from the API and use it in their project.

But as they worked on building these functions, they quickly realized that the data they were pulling from the API was messy and unorganized. Undeterred, they spent hours cleaning and organizing the data, transforming it into a format that was easy to work with and ready to be used in their project.

With their data cleaned and organized, it was time to focus on the front end of their project. Using Flask, they created a user-friendly interface with a navigation bar and buttons that allowed users to easily navigate between different pages and interact with the various features of their project.

One of the key features of their project was the ability to make predictions about the outcomes of World Cup matches. To do this, they first had to break down the scoring logic for making predictions and discuss it as a group. They then translated this logic into code, which allowed them to build the prediction functionality into their project.

As users started making predictions, they knew that they needed to create a leaderboard to track their performance. So they spent a lot of time developing this feature, testing it to ensure that it worked properly and was user-friendly.

In the end, their hard work and collaboration paid off. They had created a World Cup prediction tool that was robust, user-friendly and a lot of fun to use. As users started using their project, they received a lot of positive feedback and were proud of the work that they had done. It was a great experience and a reminder of the power of collaboration and hard work in the world of software development.
