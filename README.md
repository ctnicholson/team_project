Meet Zhi Li, a die-hard soccer fan who is excited for the upcoming World Cup. He loves watching the games and cheering for his favorite team, but he also enjoys the competition and strategic thinking involved in making decisions, and feels there is not a great platform currently out there to do so.

One day, Zhi Li learns about our World Cup prediction game and decides to give it a try. He downloads the software from GitHub, creates an account, and starts to make his predictions for the upcoming matches. He finds the user interface to be intuitive and easy to use, and he enjoys the social aspect of the game, which allows him to compete with his friends, family and students, to see who has the best predictions.

Eventually, the World Cup reaches the final stage and he is in 2nd place, incredibly close to the first place position. He is on the edge of his seat as he watches the final match, and his predictions are on the line. He has bet that Portugall will beat Argentina 2-1, and first place in the league has bet 2-1 for Argentina. In the 92nd minute of the match, Portugal get a penalty... Cristiano Ronaldo stands up to take it. Ronaldo takes a deep breath... the ref blows the whistle... Ronaldo shoots the ball into the top right corner... GOAAAALLLLLL!!! Portugal have won the World Cup and Zhi Li has won his prediction league, and has won bragging rights for the next 4 years in his friend group. He can hardly believe it , and is thrilled to see that he has come out on top of the leaderboard in his league with friends.
