Meet Zhi Li, a die-hard soccer fan who is excited for the upcoming World Cup. He loves watching the games and cheering for his favorite team, but he also enjoys the competition and strategic thinking involved in making decisions.

One day, Zhi Li learns about our World Cup prediction game and decides to give it a try. He downloads the software from GitHub, creates an account, and starts to make his predictions for the upcoming matches. He finds the user interface to be intuitive and easy to use, and he enjoys the social aspect of the game, which allows him to compete with his friends, family and students, to see who has the best predictions.

Eventually, the World Cup reaches the final stage and he is in 2nd place, incredibly close to the first place position. He is on the edge of his seat as he watches the final match, and his predictions are on the line. He can hardly believe it when his team wins the championship, and is thrilled to see that he has come out on top of the leaderboard in his league with friends and family.
